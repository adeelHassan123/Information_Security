# DES File-Based Implementation

This folder contains a C++ implementation of DES (Data Encryption Standard) that reads plaintext and key from files:

- `des.cpp`: Main DES logic, reads plaintext and key from files, processes them for DES operations.
- `keyfile.txt`, `key.txt`: Example key files.
- `plainfile.txt`, `plaintext.txt`: Example plaintext files.

These files demonstrate how DES can be used with file input/output.
