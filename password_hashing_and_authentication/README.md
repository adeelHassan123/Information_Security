# Password Hashing and Authentication

This folder contains Python scripts demonstrating various password hashing and user authentication techniques:

- `manual_sha512.py`: Manual implementation of SHA-512 for hashing username and password.
- `sha512_salt_pepper.py`: SHA-512 with salt and pepper, simulating user registration and verification.
- `hashlib_argon2.py`: Uses Python's `hashlib` and Argon2 for secure password hashing.
- `argon2_demo.py`: (Intended for Argon2 password hashing, currently empty.)

Each script demonstrates different approaches to securely storing and verifying user credentials.
