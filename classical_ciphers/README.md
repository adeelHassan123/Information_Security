# Classical Ciphers

This folder contains C++ implementations of classical ciphers:

- `playfair_cipher.cpp`: Implements the Playfair cipher for encryption and decryption.
- `rail_fence_cipher.cpp`: Implements the Rail Fence cipher for encryption and decryption.

These programs demonstrate basic cryptographic techniques used before modern algorithms.
